// You are given with two arrays where first arrray has size equal to sum of sizes of both arrays but there are less elements in it .We have to merge it 
// Eg: Array1[6]={1,2,3} and array2[3]= {2,5,6} output array={1,2,2,3,5,6}

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int arr1[6]={1,2,3};
    int arr2[3]={2,5,6};
